## Overview

Skroutz Vault ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use this Chrome extension.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What the Extension Does

Skroutz Vault operates entirely on your device and only performs the following actions when you actively use it:

1. **Search Queries:** When you enter a search term and select a search option, the extension:
   - Sends your search query to the appropriate service (Skroutz website, Google, or Skoop database)
   - Opens the search results in a new browser tab or window
   - Does not store your search queries

2. **Region Selection:** Your selected region preference is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API and is never transmitted to external servers (except as part of the search request to the selected service).

3. **No External Communication:** The extension does not communicate with any external servers, tracking services, or third-party analytics platforms beyond what is necessary to perform your requested searches.

## Data Storage

- **Local Storage:** Region preferences are stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API
- **No Server Storage:** No data is stored on any servers or transmitted to any backend infrastructure controlled by the extension developer
- **No Cloud Sync:** Your preferences are not synced to the cloud or to any service outside of your local Chrome browser

## Third-Party Services

When you perform a search using Skroutz Vault, your search query will be transmitted to one of the following third-party services based on your choice:

- **Skroutz** (skroutz.gr, skroutz.com.cy, skroutz.eu, skroutz.bg, skroutz.ro, skroutz.de) - Your search query is sent to the Skroutz website
- **Google** - Your search query is sent to Google with a domain filter for Skroutz
