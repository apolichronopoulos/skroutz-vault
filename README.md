# 🔍🎩 Skroutz Vault

This is a Chrome extension to search for the one thing Skroutz can't easily find: **old products**. 

Ever wondered about a product that's no longer listed on Skroutz? Looking for discontinued models, older versions, or vintage items? Skroutz removes old product listings, making it nearly impossible to find them through normal search. That's where Skroutz Vault comes in.

Skroutz Vault gives you instant access to search Skroutz's archived products across all supported regions with a single click. No more hunting through Google caches or old forum posts. Just type what you're looking for, pick your region, and discover products that have disappeared from the main catalog.

**Perfect for:**
- 📱 Finding older phone models and specifications
- 💻 Searching for discontinued tech products
- 🛒 Researching price history of past products
- ⭐ Updating your lists of favorite items
- 🔎 Locating products you remember but can't find anymore
- 🌍 Comparing archived products across different regions
